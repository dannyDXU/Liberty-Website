# Liberty-Website

LM Hub is a web application coded in HTML and CSS.

The hub contains the most frequently used applications for new team members and current employees all in one place. 
We pulled from our personal experiences as new team members this summer to compile the links we thought could be better highlighted. 

The hub also contains an overview of the different teams at Liberty.
This allows individuals to learn more about the technology and projects that other teams are working on. 
It also lets new members quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the important information for their own team.
